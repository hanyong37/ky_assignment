# README

This is a homework for my interview.

I used rails 5.0 + ruby-2.3.1 for my enviroment, but it doesn't mean they are hard dependencies;

to run several command line to see the test result:

%bundle install
%rails db:migrate  (or rake if you are using rails 4.x)
%rails test   (normally you can see the testing result printing on your terminal)

--That's it!
